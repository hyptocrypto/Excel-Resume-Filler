# Excel-Resume-Filler


This is a simple program used to parse through a directory filled with .pdf resumes (specifically medical applications for a staffing company ).
From each resume it extracts the name, email, and phone number of the applicant. 
The info is then filled into a data frame, sorted by job and then written into a .csv file for convenience.
